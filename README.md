# Django MBills

Django MBills library wraps around *python-mbills* in order to provide Django functionality. 

The library is pretty lightweight only containing one model and a few helper functions. APIs should be implemented by the main app as most of you use different frameworks and workflows.

## Installation

    $ pip install django-mbills

## Quick Start

TODO - include in apps, add settings, example calls...
